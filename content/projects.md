## *  Text Editor Sub System to TRACK, UNDO and REDO changes

** Synopsis ** : The UndoManager is a small, self-contained example sub-system. it is a sub-system of a text editor. In order to keep memory usage limited, the UndoManager should keep only a specified number of operations to undo (which, obviously have to be the latest changes to the document). It consists of a set of interfaces that all play together to fu lfill the task of tracking, undoing and
redoing changes to some text document.
